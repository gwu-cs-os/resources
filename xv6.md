# Running `xv6` on Mac, Linux and Windows

This guide will help you set up and run the RISC-V version of xv6 on both Mac and Linux systems.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following tools installed on your system:

- **Git**: For cloning the xv6 repository.
- **QEMU**: An emulator for running xv6.
- **RISC-V GNU Toolchain**: Required for building xv6.
- **WSL**: Windows Subsystem for Linux. (on Windows)

## Setup for macOS (Intel and ARM)

### Step 0: Please update your Mac to macOS Sonoma (version 14).

### Step 1: Install Homebrew (if not already installed)
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Step 2: Install Required Tools
```bash
brew install qemu
brew tap riscv/riscv
brew install riscv-tools
```

### Step 3: Clone the xv6-riscv Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:gwu-cs-os/xv6-riscv.git
cd xv6-riscv
```

### Step 4: Build xv6
```bash 
make
```

### Step 5: Run xv6 in QEMU
```bash 
make qemu
```

## Setup for Linux

### Step 1: Install Required Tools with `apt`

For Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, you can install the necessary packages using `apt`:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf gdb-multiarch qemu-system-misc build-essential
```

### Step 2: Clone the xv6-riscv Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:gwu-cs-os/xv6-riscv.git
cd xv6-riscv
```

### Step 3: Build xv6
```bash 
make
```

### Step 4: Run xv6 in QEMU
```bash 
make qemu
```

## Setup for Windows using WSL
### Step 1: Set Up WSL

1. **Enable WSL**: Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
    ```powershell
    wsl --install
    ```

2. **Install a Linux Distribution**: By default, Ubuntu is installed. If you want to install a different distribution, you can specify it:
    ```powershell
    wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04
    ```
	We will be using `Ubuntu-24.04` to run xv6 riscv

3. **Update WSL**: Make sure your WSL version is up to date:
    ```powershell
    wsl --update
    ```

4. **Launch WSL**: Open Ubuntu-24.04 from the Start menu.
	```powershell
	wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04
	```

### Step 2: Install Required Tools in WSL

Once inside your WSL environment, install the necessary tools:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf gdb-multiarch qemu-system-misc build-essential
```

### Step 3: Clone the xv6-riscv Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:gwu-cs-os/xv6-riscv.git
cd xv6-riscv
```

### Step 4: Build xv6
```bash 
make
```

### Step 5: Run xv6 in QEMU
```bash 
make qemu
```

## Verifying xv6 Setup

Follow these steps to verify that xv6 is running correctly:

### Step 1: Boot into xv6

Assuming everything has been set up and built properly, you should be able to boot into xv6, which is an operating system modeled after version 6 of Bell Labs Research Unix.

### Step 2: Display the README
Once youâ€™re in xv6, display the contents of the `README` file by running the following command: 
```bash 
cat README
```
This command should print the contents of the `README` file to the console.

### Step 3: Exit xv6
Exit xv6 by hitting ctrl+a (releasing both keys) and x.

# `xv6` hints and tricks

## Formatting

It is important to properly indent, and to consistently format your code.
We've helped with this by providing a formatting file that encodes the repo's style.
You should run it before `commit`ing with:

```
$ sh format.sh
```

## Documentation

Note that the `xv6` book has a great overview of the design of the *entire* system.
Please use it [as a resource](https://github.com/gwu-cs-os/xv6-riscv/blob/riscv/xv6-book.pdf) if you need it.
Note that since you don't own this repo, you cannot `git push` to it.
You have to fork it on `github` to become the owner of your own fork.
For this class, all assignments will be completed on repos that we provide for you.

**Some hints for understanding the code-base.**
The source has a few different types of software:

- The kernel: in `kernel/` with all of the objects listed in the [Makefile](https://github.com/gwu-cs-os/xv6-riscv/blob/riscv/Makefile#L4).
- The user-level applications: in `user/` with the objects also listed in the [Makefile](https://github.com/gwu-cs-os/xv6-riscv/blob/riscv/Makefile#L125).
- The librarys linked into every user-level applications are the files listed in the [Makefile](https://github.com/gwu-cs-os/xv6-riscv/blob/riscv/Makefile#L97).

When you're looking at a `.c` or `.h` file, always make sure you understand if it is executing in user-space (thus must make a system call to enter the kernel), or is in the kernel (thus can directly call functions within the kernel).
Using a code indexing system will make it easier to walk through the source code.
`ggtags` or `ctags` for emacs does great, but there are corresponding technologies for nearly all editors (and can be generated with [`make tags`](https://github.com/gwu-cs-os/xv6-riscv/blob/riscv/Makefile#L94)).

## Adding new files

- When you want to add a user-level program, you simply implement it as a `.c` file in `user/`, and add it, appropriately, to the list of `UPROGS` in the `Makefile`.
- When you want create a library (a `.c` file in `xv6`) that is compiled into each program, add it, appropriately, to the list of `ULIB` in the `Makefile`.
- If you want to add a new file -- for example, `new.txt` -- to the root file system (i.e. a file you can use to open, cat, etc...), you do the following (as another resource, see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47250441/add-a-generic-file-in-xv6-makefile)):

	1.
	   ```
	   fs.img: mkfs README new.txt $(UPROGS)
	   ./mkfs fs.img README new.txt $(UPROGS)
	   ```
	2.
	   ```
	   PRINT = runoff.list runoff.spec README new.txt toc.hdr toc.ftr $(FILES)
	   ```
	3.
	   ```
	   EXTRA=\
	   mkfs.c ulib.c user.h cat.c echo.c forktest.c grep.c kill.c\
	   ln.c ls.c mkdir.c rm.c stressfs.c usertests.c wc.c zombie.c\
	   printf.c umalloc.c\
	   README new.txt dot-bochsrc *.pl toc.* runoff runoff1 runoff.list\
	   .gdbinit.tmpl gdbutil
	   ```
     
## Running out of disk blocks to hold the programs and files

When you add more files (e.g. test files) into the system, you may run out of blocks.
You can increase the number of blocks in the system by increasing the `FSSIZE` variable.
Sometimes it is necessary to increase `BSIZE` as well.

## Debugging with `gdb`

Please see [this section on xv6](https://github.com/gwu-cs-os/resources/blob/master/gdb.md#xv6-specific-stuff) in the gdb resources.

## Errors running `sign.pl`

If your `make` is breaking when trying to run `sign.pl`, try and run the command at which `make` breaks.

For example, if it breaks on:

```
...
./sign.pl bootblock
make: ./sign.pl: Command not found
...
```

...try running `./sign.pl bootblock`. 
If the error it reports has a `^M` in it, you have somehow copied some of the `xv6` files through Windows, which uses [CR/LF newlines](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-unix-linux-convert-dos-newlines-cr-lf-unix-text-format/).
Linux (i.e. WSL) doesn't understand these newlines.

A simple and quick fix would be to copy the file's content from github and replace the content on your local machine. If the issue persists, then you must continue below.
To update the `sign.pl` file to have proper Linux newlines, you can (install and) use the `dos2unix` program: `dos2unix sign.pl` which removes the `^M` newline.

## Exiting QEMU
Use `CTRL+A`, then `X` to quit xv6 and return to your terminal.
